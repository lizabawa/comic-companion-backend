# COMICCOMPANION

## Project Description
ComicCompanion is a mock portfolio website for a comic artist to display their work where users can come and read the artists comics. This is the back-end for the application.

## Project Approach
- I used the project management application [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to keep track of project tasks, important links, and brainstorming ideas
![Notion Project Manager](https://github.com/lizabawa/comic-companion-backend/blob/main/src/main/resources/images/Notion.png?raw=true)
- My approach to this project was to create a bare-bone front end first, then the backend, and then connect the two before completing any additional CSS
- Before I began any coding, I planned my backend-end out by creating user stories, and ERD diagram, and listing my endpoints.


### User Stories

## Tools and Technologies Used

The following is a list of the tools and technologies that were employed in the development of this project:
- **[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/):** The code editor of choice, offering robust features for debugging and source code editing.
- **[Java](https://www.java.com/en/):** Utilized for creating the basic structure of the web application.
  These tools and technologies were integral in delivering a high-quality, user-friendly application.
- **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/):** A software project management and comprehension tool.
- **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/):** An API platform for building and using APIs.
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/):** Version control and collaboration platform.
- **[App Diagrams](https://app.diagrams.net/):** Used for designing the ERD.
- **[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/):** Used for organizing the endpoints.

## Dependencies
- Springboot
- JUnit
- H2 Database

## Hurdles Encountered During Development
- Creating the tests before creating the service and controller was challenging. I was able to create the tests before the service class and keep editing both until the test ran. I unintentionally completed the controller class before I started the tests but in the end still successfully created the test for both.
- Getting the images to display on the frontend took a while due to not knowing which image URL to use. I ultimately ended up using the image url from the backend GitHub repository. However, an issue I became aware of is that even though Angular updates its UI automatically, since I changed the image URL on the backend, it was not automatically displaying unless I refreshed the frontend localhost page. This mistake cost me a lot of time because I could have been using the correct image URL on the backend but the frontend UI was simply not updating which led me to think the problem persisted.
## Key Achievements
- The frontend is successfully retrieving data from the API.
- Exceptions and endpoints are working correctly.
